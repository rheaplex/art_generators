art_generators - Create & manage the lifecycle of digital art projects
======================================================================

NOT READY FOR USE YET.

Currently only SVG-based projects are supported.

Inspired by Ruby on Rails.


Making a Project
----------------

> art_project project-name

This will create a folder named project-name.

The folder contains a number of files and directories.

Edit README to describe the project, and COPYING to describe the license terms of the project.

The Resources folder contains template.svg, which you can edit to set a default paper size and other features.


Making a Work
-------------

In the project folder, type:

> script/work new-work.svg

This will make a new work called new-work.svg in the Preparatory directory by copying resources/template.svg.

If you wish to start from another work in the Preparatory folder, type:

> script/work -c new-work.svg even-newer-work.svg

This will make a new work called new-work.svg in the Preparatory directory by copying Preparatory/new-work.svg .

If you wish to start from another work in the another folder within the project folder, type:

> script/work -c Final/new-work.svg even-newer-work.svg

This will make a new work called new-work.svg in the Preparatory directory by copying Final/new-work.svg .

Specifying works to copy with a slash in the name will cause the work to be copied from that folder in the project directory, not specifying a folder will default to the Preparatory folder.
